<li> bug in sign up window - picture is jumping up and down when trying to submit a previously submitted email
<li> do not forget changing cookie to one minute.
<li> api route is a bit weird - maybe need to change it? (making it post)
A started template for your project

<h2> Current pages</h2>
<li> '/' redirects to login page
<li> '/login' is login page (not yet merged)</li>
<li> 'register' is finished, uses post + get</li>
<li> 'registrationComplete' needs to get pretty. on post shows simple html, on get redirects to login</li>
<li> 'api/resources' for email retrieval, probably needs to change to something more logical</li>
